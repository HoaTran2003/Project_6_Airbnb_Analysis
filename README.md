PROJECT 6: AIRBNB ANALYSIS 

#Overview

Airbnb is a company founded in 2008 that operates an online marketplace for hospitality services. Users looking for places to reside can browse available listings by location, dates available, characteristics, amenities, and price. Home-owners can list their properties for short- or long-term rent. 
There are a wide variety of customers who use Airbnb: some renters are tourists, wanting short term stays near popular attractions at cheaper prices and more homely environments than traditional hotels. Others are business travelers, looking for similar features. Similarly, some home-owners act as permanent landlords, owning multiple properties and renting them out on a permanent basis. Others have spare bedrooms or space and want to earn a little extra money on the side. Some even rent their home when they are out of town.

In this project,  we will explore factors that affect the price of rental units in Columbus, Ohio. We will examine characteristics of the rentals, geographic locations, and time considerations. This will serve both a descriptive and a predictive analytics purpose: descriptive in the sense that interpreting regression models can help us understand what factors are the most critical to the price and how they affect it; and predictive in estimating what the price of a rental is, given certain factors that could be measured. Predictions can be used from both the renter and owner perspective: renters can understand whether a property is fairly priced and identify good deals, and owners can receive suggestions about how to price their properties.
