We have 2 daughters and 3 grandchildren, all of whom live in Columbus.  I've been a yoga teacher since 1988. I have taught at Yoga on High since it's inception in 2000 and earned my certification from Yoga Alliance of ERYT 500 at Yoga on High. I love sharing this ancient practice with all kinds of people. I have seen it have profound effects on people's lives. It is an honor and a responsibility for which I am very grateful. 
 Eric and I have lived in this historic home for over 35 years, in what we consider the best neighborhood in the city, Olde Towne. We love sharing our home with friends and now airbnb guests. We enjoy walking in the woods, gardening, biking, kayaking, reading and, of course, practicing yoga. 
We also love to travel. We've been told we are easy guests. We like to take care of ourselves and not add unduly to our hosts workload. Car camping is a favorite vacation of ours.
 I'd say our airbnb hosting style is also casual: I try to think of anything a guest might need and supply it, so they can have a relaxed stay with us. We have maps of the neighborhood and menus for the local cafes and the bakery in a notebook in The Loft. We try to help out with rides when we can. We have a table in The Loft that is perfect for working or dining. A guest set up her sewing machine up there.

People always ask if it’s weird to have strangers come and stay in my home with me and the answer has always been “not once!” I really love having the opportunity to share my home and city of Columbus Ohio with travelers from all over the world. So far I have welcomed people from 6 out of 7 continents coming from more than 75 different countries.

When I bought my home in 2008 it had broken plumbing, boarded up windows, and had been the ugly house on the block for a long time. It’s taken a lot of time and patience but a house that was forgotten and uninhabitable became a warm and charming place I like to call home. 

I’m proud of the work I’ve done to bring a historic building back to life and update it in a way that kept much of the original character. Be careful asking questions about the process because I may not stop telling stories for a while.

In the fall of 2019 I adopted a husky/boxer puppy.  Her name is Juneau and she is super friendly and loves welcoming guests to our home.

I’m Jake. I’m originally from New York, and while I miss my friends and family back home (not to mention the beach!), I absolutely love my mid-west home here in Columbus, Ohio!
By day I’m a real estate investor and by night I’m a social butterfly with my friends. I'm also an Airbnb cohost where I mentor aspiring local hosts. I earned my Superhost status because I have high standards for value, cleanliness, and communication.
I enjoy travelling and creating new experiences. My favorite country is Guatemala. The people, the food and the historical sites are breathtaking. My favorite city is Chicago. Through these travels and coupled with my 14 years landlording, I’ve been fortunate to learn what makes a great host: a great home, with a friendly host, in an awesome neighborhood, and the ability to do the things you love! I try to ensure that each and every guest I host walks away with all of that and hopefully more.
My life motto is, well, really my grandmother’s advice, “Jakey, live with NO REGRETS” (I can hear her thick NYer accent now). Sometimes I guess we just need a little reminder of that… And so, I invite you to travel more and see the big, beautiful world we live in.

I’m Jake. I’m originally from New York, and while I miss my friends and family back home (not to mention the beach!), I absolutely love my mid-west home here in Columbus, Ohio!
By day I’m a real estate investor and by night I’m a social butterfly with my friends. I'm also an Airbnb cohost where I mentor aspiring local hosts. I earned my Superhost status because I have high standards for value, cleanliness, and communication.
I enjoy travelling and creating new experiences. My favorite country is Guatemala. The people, the food and the historical sites are breathtaking. My favorite city is Chicago. Through these travels and coupled with my 14 years landlording, I’ve been fortunate to learn what makes a great host: a great home, with a friendly host, in an awesome neighborhood, and the ability to do the things you love! I try to ensure that each and every guest I host walks away with all of that and hopefully more.
My life motto is, well, really my grandmother’s advice, “Jakey, live with NO REGRETS” (I can hear her thick NYer accent now). Sometimes I guess we just need a little reminder of that… And so, I invite you to travel more and see the big, beautiful world we live in.

Initially platted in 1814 in Columbus' South End, German Village was generally developed between years 1840 and 1914. It was settled largely by German immigrants in the mid-1800s.  German descendants at one time comprised as much as one-third of the population of Columbus.  Restoration began in 1959 and the Historic District was established in 1963.  German Village was the FIRST historic district in the U.S. and it remains a model for all that came after.  In the year 1974, German Village joined the Historic Register.  Today, more than 1,600 preservations have been completed.  <br /><br />Purdy Haus dates to at least the year 1910 when it was occupied by a woodworker/barber George C. McMillin.  Nearby homes date between years 1884 and 1888, so it may be older.<br /><br />Walk everywhere - sidewalks are wide - people are warm - parks and restaurants are plentiful!

People always ask if it’s weird to have strangers come and stay in my home with me and the answer has always been “not once!” I really love having the opportunity to share my home and city of Columbus Ohio with travelers from all over the world. So far I have welcomed people from 6 out of 7 continents coming from more than 75 different countries.

When I bought my home in 2008 it had broken plumbing, boarded up windows, and had been the ugly house on the block for a long time. It’s taken a lot of time and patience but a house that was forgotten and uninhabitable became a warm and charming place I like to call home. 

I’m proud of the work I’ve done to bring a historic building back to life and update it in a way that kept much of the original character. Be careful asking questions about the process because I may not stop telling stories for a while.

In the fall of 2019 I adopted a husky/boxer puppy.  Her name is Juneau and she is super friendly and loves welcoming guests to our home.

I’m Jake. I’m originally from New York, and while I miss my friends and family back home (not to mention the beach!), I absolutely love my mid-west home here in Columbus, Ohio!
By day I’m a real estate investor and by night I’m a social butterfly with my friends. I'm also an Airbnb cohost where I mentor aspiring local hosts. I earned my Superhost status because I have high standards for value, cleanliness, and communication.
I enjoy travelling and creating new experiences. My favorite country is Guatemala. The people, the food and the historical sites are breathtaking. My favorite city is Chicago. Through these travels and coupled with my 14 years landlording, I’ve been fortunate to learn what makes a great host: a great home, with a friendly host, in an awesome neighborhood, and the ability to do the things you love! I try to ensure that each and every guest I host walks away with all of that and hopefully more.
My life motto is, well, really my grandmother’s advice, “Jakey, live with NO REGRETS” (I can hear her thick NYer accent now). Sometimes I guess we just need a little reminder of that… And so, I invite you to travel more and see the big, beautiful world we live in.

Having stayed on friend's couches, in numerous hotel rooms, BNB's, and Airbnb the conversation has always centered on what would we do differently as a host.  From having a throw blanket for lounging on the couch, that certain kitchen tool, green space outside,  to having games available to play as a group or family.

Leave us your leftovers (and scrap remnants if you like) in the refrigerator. The local composting company we work with that will even take meat and bones. 

Each of our animals has their own distinct personalities that make us smile and want to give them a hug.  This does not mean that everyone else does though. We each have several family members with pet allergies so we want there to be somewhere that is pet free, has items in it that have not been in contact with animals, like Wincott Place, to keep allergies at bay.

We are Igor, Boris and Susan - friends that are happy to open up our home to host you and your group in the wonderful city of Columbus. 

A few words about us:

Igor is a financial analyst that has been working in the industry for nearly a decade.

Boris and Susan are a young, professional couple originally from Lithuania and China. 

We all love to travel ourselves and try to stay at Airbnb wherever we go. 

Between all of us, we've been to probably over a 100 Airbnbs over the years and have seen a range from unbelievably beautiful ones to the not-so-good ones.

My name is Kyle. My wife, Anna, and myself got married in the end of 2016. With all of our families living out of state/country, we have grown accustomed to having others staying with us over, and so finished our basement to allow others to use our space.

It had previously been an area of family operated farms and countryside stretching along the National Road, Main Street from Washington D.C. In 1882, trolley tracks were laid on Oak Street to Kelton Ave where the streetcar barn still stands, providing convenient transportation to the former location of the Ohio State Fairgrounds, (now Franklin Park Conservatory), and to downtown Columbus. Olde Towne East saw many of Columbus’s finest homes built within the area and much of that architectural legacy still exists today. There are more than a thousand uniquely styled homes in the Olde Towne East area, some built as early as 1830, representing over 50 unique architectural styles. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Olde Towne East represented some of the most popular American building styles spanning 100 years, which included: Federal, Italianate, Victorian, Queen Anne, Gothic Revival, Tudor.

I’m Jake. I’m originally from New York, and while I miss my friends and family back home (not to mention the beach!), I absolutely love my mid-west home here in Columbus, Ohio!
By day I’m a real estate investor and by night I’m a social butterfly with my friends. I'm also an Airbnb cohost where I mentor aspiring local hosts. I earned my Superhost status because I have high standards for value, cleanliness, and communication.
I enjoy travelling and creating new experiences. My favorite country is Guatemala. The people, the food and the historical sites are breathtaking. My favorite city is Chicago. Through these travels and coupled with my 14 years landlording, I’ve been fortunate to learn what makes a great host: a great home, with a friendly host, in an awesome neighborhood, and the ability to do the things you love! I try to ensure that each and every guest I host walks away with all of that and hopefully more.
My life motto is, well, really my grandmother’s advice, “Jakey, live with NO REGRETS” (I can hear her thick NYer accent now). Sometimes I guess we just need a little reminder of that… And so, I invite you to travel more and see the big, beautiful world we live in.

Chad and Victoria here. We both live and work in Columbus, having both graduated from The Ohio State University. We love everything about the city, the vibrant surrounding neighborhoods and are so happy you chose to visit us. 

The Short North has been a very special part of our story together.  We got engaged at Goodale Park, which is a short and highly recommended walk away. We got our start as a young married couple living just a stone’s throw away from this residence. 

We're a couple passionate about our city and also traveling the world. Whether we are scootering around Columbus, jet-skiing in Costa Rica, off roading in Aruba, or cruising up Highway 1 in a convertible in California - we want to be fully present in the culture and surroundings we find ourselves in. Columbus is our hometown and we want you to love it as much as we do! 

If we're not using our travel points to fly somewhere around the globe, you'll find Chad training for his next half marathon or scouting out an epic new pizza to try. Victoria on the other hand was a 2x All American NCAA Champion rower at The Ohio State University and a proud plant and dog mom. We are passionate about being physically active and love getting outside to explore! We are working on our goal of knocking out all of the U.S. National Parks, and are making progress on the globe scratch-off map we got for our first Christmas together. 

Relationships, like community, are very important to us. Our philosophy is every guest is a part of our “family” once they choose to stay in one of our Airbnbs. Columbus is our home, and we hope even for the short duration of your stay with us that it feels like your home too. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions during your stay. 

We hope the time in our space gives you a glimpse of life in Columbus! Thank you for choosing to stay with us!
